## Description

Welcome to the CSS Snippet Cheatsheet, created based on mini-project 2 at UT Austin's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. This was the first project I was tasked with re-creating an image starting from scratch. 

Here is the original reference photo:

I was motiviated to build a project from scratch using only a reference photo in order to practice design, semantic HTML layout, appropriate div usage, and newly learned CSS tricks such as flexbox, media queries, and pseudo-selectors. This project also serves as a solution for quick and easy CSS references revlolving around flexbox. This was also the first time I wire-framed a project, which allowed me to see all of the barebones elements laid out on a page. One of my biggest personal challenges right now is keeping track of HTML layouts, and wireframing was a helpful process to curb this issue.

My wireframe via Google Slides

I learned how to wireframe, use flexbox CSS selectors to make my page responsive, and how to layout an HTML page with multiple sections and divs. 

Once I completed the key concepts of this challenge, I swithced my color scheme to show pride for the Denver Broncos - my home state NFL team.

## Installation

No installation neccessary.
Thanks to media queries and flexbox, the page is available to view on mobile and desktop. Tablet view will be available soon.

## Usage

Hovering over the individual cards will cause a glow effect on all devices. (For mobile, tab the code cards.)

Desktop:

Mobile:

A single click on the code blocks (desktop only) will select and highlight all of the preformatted code for easy copy-paste.

Shrinking or expaning the size of the window will cause the content to move/flex.
